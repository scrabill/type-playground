Basics

As I have gotten further into my degree program, I have learned there is way more to typography than meets the eye. It is not always as simple as selecting a typeface and a point size...no..the whole of the design, the medium, as well as its designated audience carries a big part in separating 'good' typography from 'bad' typography.
In addition to learning through trial and error, I found that absorbing information from differant resources helps to broaden your knowledge of the subject. Included here are a few good links to articles about the basics of typography. These links are great for beginners, as well as pros looking for a quick refresher course.

Games

Now, who here like games? Typography? Well, if you answered 'yes' to at least one of those, have I got some treats for you. From a typography version of space invaders, to quizzes, to interactive type cities, over the past year or so I have collected links to some of the 'funner' type-related  places on the internet. Click a link and have fun; some of these are very addictive!
