On a sidenote, you mentioned we'll just be using the AIGA DC chapter logo for the time being, should we have a banner to post either on front of behind our table? I've been to clubfest almost every quarter I've been here, and the clubs representing almost never have a banner....if its allowed, I think it will really set us apart from everyone else.
